## Deployment

The Repository component is based on Angular (https://angular.io/). The deployment of this web application depends on the selected cloud computing provider. Each cloud computing provider provides its own deployment manual. In the case of Microsoft’s Azure one option is Azure Pipelines. You can find more information at the following URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/azure/app-service/deploy-azure-pipelines?view=azure-devops&tabs=yaml.
